# <span style="color:#E62794">NatsukiVision</span> Discord Theme

Based on [Clearvision](https://github.com/ClearVision/ClearVision-v6) by [the Clearvision Team](https://github.com/ClearVision). This Theme is specifically made for [Vencord](https://vencord.dev), but it should also work for [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/) and any other injectors that **Clearvision** supports.

**Natsuki**: The embodiment of pure delight and boundless happiness, also the epitome of joy, she symbolizes unending bliss and contentment.

This theme takes her the center point, everything is Natsuki-themed, from the background to the User Popout. It replaces the usual, boring Discord Font to **DFPPOPCorn-W12**<sup><a href="#Footnote 1">1</a></sup>, which is the Font used in [Touhou 6: Embodiment of Scarlet Devil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil), and replaces the normal Discord Code Font to [**OCR A Extended**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/ocr-a-extended).

The Theme uses the following Plugins:
- [Radialstatus](https://github.com/DiscordStyles/RadialStatus)
- [Discolored](https://github.com/NYRI4/Discolored)
- [ServerRings](https://github.com/DiscordStyles/SoftX)<sup><a href="#Footnote 2">2</a></sup>

It modifies ServerRings via Custom CSS due to some issues I faced previously. Mainly it makes the rings smaller, thicker, and re-aligns them.

The artist of the images changed is [italy2003](https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/66835722)<a href="#Footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a>.

In short, if you want to use the images, you **must** contact the artist.

### Installing
The location of the destination folder may vary depending on your injector. However, as a general guideline, it can typically be accessed by navigating through the following steps: "Settings" -> "Themes" -> "Open Themes Folder."

For the default theme, you **must** have the **DFPPOPCorn-W12**<sup><a href="#Footnote 1">1</a></sup> Font installed! If you do not have it installed, it *should* revert to Discord's default Font, however, I cannot guarantee this. If you run into issues, go into the line `--main-font:` and replace it with any font that you have installed. You can view your installed Fonts in **Control Panel** -> **Appearance and Personalization** -> **Fonts**. If you want a suggestion, you can use `Comic Sans` if you prefer it or have Dyslexia (It supposedly is great for Dyslexic people) or `Sans Serif` if you just need a quick pre-installed Font that's readable.

### Reporting bugs

Search on the [Issues](https://github.com/Wehrmachtserdbeere/CV-NatsukiVision/issues) page if it has already been reported. If not, then please [open a new Issue](https://github.com/Wehrmachtserdbeere/CV-NatsukiVision/issues/new) and provide a detailed report on what is bugged. Add images if possible and relevant, and provide a list of Addons/Plugins if they have the possibility of influencing the bug.

If your bug is that the ServerRings are misaligned, please refer to the theme.css and search (CTRL+F) for `margin-left:` then adjust it until it looks right. Most injectors use live-updating, so cross-referencing if it looks right will be very easy.

### Private Theme
The theme labeled "Private Do Not Use" is explicitly designated for private <span style="color:#fff">use</span> and is <span style="color:red">**not**</span> intended for public utilization. Its purpose is solely for personal convenience and is deemed <span style="color:red">**unsuitable**</span> for public consumption. I must emphasize the imperative nature of refraining from employing the private theme. I <span style="color:red">**cannot**</span> assure its functionality if utilized outside of its intended personal context. Therefore, <span style="color:#fff">it</span> is reiterated that the private theme is <span style="color:red">**exclusively**</span> reserved for my personal use.

### Footnotes

<div id="Footnote 1"><sup>1. Due to uncertainty regarding the legitimacy of pages hosting the Font, I refrained from providing direct links. Please feel free to substitute the Font with any alternative installed on your system or integrated within your Windows environment.</sup></div>
<div id="Footnote 2"><sup>2. The add-on in question does not possess an independent repository. Instead, it is integrated within SoftX. Consequently, SoftX is associated with it.</sup></div>
<div id="Footnote 3"><sup>3. The artist publishes material unsuitable for individuals under the age of 18. While the website offers the option to obscure sexual imagery, I cannot ensure that all sexually suggestive content is consistently obscured beyond recognition.</sup></div>
<div id="Footnote 4"><sup>4. Given that this license pertains to content beyond the modifications made to the original code, and in consideration of having obtained explicit permission from the artist to utilize their images within this context, it is thereby affirmed that no infringements upon any licenses affiliated with this project have been committed.</sup></div>
